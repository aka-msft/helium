## Azure App Service

Build, deploy, and scale enterprise-grade web, mobile, and API apps running on any platform. Meet rigorous performance, scalability, security and compliance requirements while using a fully managed platform to perform infrastructure maintenance.

- service_plan_resource_group_name : The Name of the Resource Group where the Service Plan exists.
- app_service_plan_id : The ID of the App Service Plan within which the App Service exists is populated automatically based on service plan.
- tags : A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
- app_settings : A key-value pair of App Settings. Settings for private Container Registries
  - DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_URL : The docker registry server URL for app service to be created
  - DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_USERNAME : The docker registry server usernames for app services to be created
  - DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVER_PASSWORD : The docker registry server passwords for app services to be created
  - APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY : The Instrumentation Key for the Application Insights component used for app service to be created.
- site_config : 
  - always_on : Should the app be loaded at all times? Defaults to false.
  - virtual_network_name : The name of the Virtual Network which this App Service should be attached to.

## Usage

### Module Definitions

The App Service is dependent on deployment of Service Plan. Make sure to deploy Service Plan before starting to deploy App Services. If you would like to monitor insights from your app service please deploy App Insights Module too.

- Service Plan Module : infra/modules/providers/azure/service-plan
- App Insights Module : infra/modules/providers/azure/app-insights
- App Service Module : infra/modules/providers/azure/app-service

```
variable "resource_group_name" {
  value = "test-rg"
}

variable "service_plan_name" {
  value = "test-svcplan"
}

variable "appinsights_name" {
  value = "test-appinsights"
}

variable "app_service_name" {
  value = {
    appservice1="DOCKER|<user1/image1:tag1>"
    appservice2="DOCKER|<user2/image2:tag2>"
  }
}

module "service_plan" {
  source                  = "github.com/Microsoft/cobalt/infra/modules/providers/azure/service-plan"
  resource_group_name     = "${var.resource_group_name}"
  resource_group_location = "${var.resource_group_location}"
  service_plan_name       = "${var.service_plan_name}"
}

module "app_insights" {
  source                               = "github.com/Microsoft/cobalt/infra/modules/providers/azure/app-insights"
  service_plan_resource_group_name     = "${var.resource_group_name}"
  appinsights_name                     = "${var.appinsights_name}"
}

module "app_service" {
  source                           = "github.com/Microsoft/cobalt/infra/modules/providers/azure/app-service"
  service_plan_resource_group_name = "${var.resource_group_name}"
  service_plan_name                = "${var.service_plan_name}"
```

## Outputs

Once the deployments are completed successfully, the output for the current module will be in the format mentioned below:

```
Outputs:

app_service_uri = [
    appservice1.azurewebsites.net,
    appservice2.azurewebsites.net
]
```
