# Cobalt Test Base Image

This is the base image used for running terratest based unit and integration GO tests. This image comes pre-packaged with the following dependencies:
* Go programming language: Terraform test cases are written in [Go](https://golang.org/dl/).
* dep: [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep#installation) is a dependency management tool for Go.
* Azure CLI: The [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) is a command-line tool you can use to manage Azure resources. (Terraform supports authenticating to Azure through a service principal or via the Azure CLI.)
* mage: We use the mage go [module](https://github.com/magefile/mage#installation) to show you how to simplify running Terratest cases.
